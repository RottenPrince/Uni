## **1.2.2 Types of OSPF Packets**
Link-state packets are the tools used by **OSPF** to help determine the fastest available route for a packet. **OSPF** uses the following link-state packets (**LSPs**) to establish and maintain neighbor adjacencies and exchange routing updates. Each packet serves a specific purpose in the **OSPF** routing process, as follows:
- **Type 1: Hello packet** - This is used to establish and maintain adjacency with other **OSPF** routers.
- **Type2: Database Description (DBD) packet** - This contains an abbreviated list of the **LSDB** of the sending router and is used by receiving routers to check against the local **LSDB**. The **LSDB** must be identical on all link-state routers within an area to construct and accurate SPF tree.
- **Type3: Link-State Request (LSR) packet** - Receiving routers can then request more information about any entry in the **DBD** by sending an **LSR**.
- **Type4: Link-State Update (LSU) packet** - This is used to reply to **LSRs** and to announce new information. **LSUs** contain several different types of **LSAs**.
- **Type5: Link-State Acknowledgment (LSAck) packet** - When an LSU is received, the router sends an **LSAck** to confirm receipt of the **LSU**. The **LSAck** data field is empty.

The table summarized the five different types of LSPs used by OSPFv2. OSPFv3 has similar packet types.

| Type | Packet Name                        | Description                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Hello                              | Discovers neighbors and builds adjacencies between them    |
| 2    | Database Description(DBD)          | Checks for databases synchronization between routers       |
| 3    | Link-State Request (LSR)           | Requests specific link-state records from router to router |
| 4    | Link-State Update (LSU)            | Sends specifically requested link-state records            |
| 5    | Link-State Acknowledgement (LSAck) | Acknowledges the other packet types                        |

## 1.2.3 **Link-State Updates**

- Routers initially exchange Type 2 **DBD** packets, which is an abbreviated list of the **LSDB** of the sending route. It is used by receiving routers to check against the local **LSDB**.
- A Type 3 **LSR** packet is used by the receiving routers to request more information about an entry in the **DBD**.
- The Type 4 LSU packet is used to reply to an LSR packet.
- A Type 5 packet is used to acknowledge the receipt of a Type 4 LSU.
- LSUs are also used to forward OSPF routing updates, such as link changes. Specifically, an LSU packet can contain 11 different types of OSPFv2 LSAs, with some of the more common ones shown in the figure OSPFv3 renamed several of these LSAs and also contains two additional LSAs.
- **Note**: The difference between the LSU and LSA terms can sometimes be confusing because the terms are often used interchangeably. However, an LSU contains one or more LSAs.

LSUs Contain LSAs

## 1.2.4 Hello Packet

The OSPF Type 1 packet is the Hello packet. Hello packets are used to do the following:
- Discover OSPF neighbors and establish neighbor adjacencies. Advertise parameters on which two routers must agree to become neighbors.
- Advertise parameters on which two routers must agree to become neighbors.
- Elect the Designated Router (DR) and Back Designated Router (BDR) on multiaccess networks like Ethernet. Point-to-point links do not require DR or BDR.
The figure displays the fields contained in the OSPFv2 Type 1 Hello packet.
