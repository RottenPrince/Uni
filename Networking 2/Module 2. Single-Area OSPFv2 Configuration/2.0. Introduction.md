## 2.0.1 Why should I take this module?
Welcome to Single-Area OSPFv2 Configuration!

Now that you know about single-area OSPFv2, you can probably think of all the ways it could benefit your own network. As a link-state protocol, OSPF is designed to not only find the fastest available route, it is designed to _create_ fast, available routes. If you prefer a bit more control over some areas of your network, OSPF gives you several ways to manually override the DR election process and create your own preferred routes. With OSPF, your network can combine the automated processes with your own choices to make a network that you could troubleshoot in your sleep! You know you want to learn how to do this!

## 2.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?
**Module Title:** Single-Area OSPFv2 Configuration

**Module Objective:** Implement single-area OSPFv2 in both point-to-point and broadcast multiaccess networks.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OSPF Router ID               | Configure an OSPFv2 router ID.                                                                   |
| Point-to-Point OSPF Networks | Configure single-area OSPFv2 in a point-to-point network.                                        |
| Multiaccess OSPF Networks    | Configure the OSPF interface priority to influence the DR/BDR election in a multiaccess network. |
| Modify Single-Area OSPFv2    | Implement modifications to change the operation of single-area OSPFv2.                           |
| Default Route Propagation    | Configure OPSF to propagate a default route.                                                     |
| Verify Single-Area OSPFv2    | Verify a single-area OSPFv2 implementation                                                       |
