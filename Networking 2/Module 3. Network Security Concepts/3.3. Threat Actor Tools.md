## 3.3.1 Video - Threat Actor Tools
As you learned in the previous topic, there are different types of hackers with different motivations for what they do. In this topic, you will learn about some of the tools these individuals use.


## 3.3.2 Introduction to Attack Tools
To exploit a vulnerability, a threat actor must have a technique or tool. Over the years, attack tools have become more sophisticated, and highly automated. These new tools require less technical knowledge to implement.

In the figure, drag the white circle across the timeline to view the relationship between the sophistication of attack tools versus the technical knowledge required to use them.

## 3.3.3 Evolution of Security Tools
Ethical hacking involves many different types of tools used to test the network and keep its data secure. To validate the security of a network and its systems, many network penetration testing tools have been developed. It is unfortunate that many of these tools can be used by black hat hackers for exploitation.

Black hat hackers have also created many hacking tools. These tools are created explicitly for nefarious reasons. White hat hackers must also know how to use these tools when performing network penetration tests.

The table highlights categories of common penetration testing tools. Notice how some tools are used by white hats and black hats. Keep in mind that the list is not exhaustive as new tools are always being developed.

## 3.3.4 Attack Types
Threat actors can use the previously mentioned attack tools, or a combination of tools, to create attacks. The table displays common types of attacks. However, the list of attacks is not exhaustive as new attack vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered.

| Attack Types                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eavesdropping Attack               | This is when a threat actor captures and "listens" to network traffic. This attack is also referred to as sniffing or snooping.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Data Modification Attack           | If threat actors have captured enterprise traffic, they can alter the data in the packet without the knowledge of the sender or receiver.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ip Address Spoofing Attack         | A threat actor constructs an IP packet that appears to originate from a valid address inside the corporate intranet.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Password-Based Attacks             | If threat actors discover a valid user account, the threat actors have the same rights as the real user. Threat actors could use that valid account to obtain lists of other users,                                                                                                                            |
| Denial of Service Attack           | A DoS attack prevents normal use of a computer or network by valid users. A DoS attack can flood computer or the entire network with traffic until a shutdown occurs because of the overload. A DoS attack can also block traffic, which results in a loss of access to network resources by authorized users. |
| Man-in-the-Middle Attack           | This attack occurs when threats actors have positioned themselves between a source and destination. They can now actively monitor, capture, and control the communication transparently.                                                                                                                       |
| Fuzzers to Seartch Vulnerabilities | If a threat actor obtains a secret key, that key is referred to as a compromised key. A compromised key can be used to gain access to a secured communication without the sender or receiver being aware of the attack.                                                                                        |
| Forensic Tools                     | A sniffer is an application or device that can read, monitor, and capture network data exchanges and read network packets. If the packets are not encrypted, a sniffer provides a full view of the data inside the packer.                                                                                     |
