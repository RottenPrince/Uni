## 3.10.1 Video - Cryptography
Early in the previous topic, cryptography is mentioned as part of the CIA information security triad. In this topic you will get a deeper dive into the many types of cryptography and how they are used to secure the network.

## 3.10.2 Securing Communications
Organizations must provide support to secure the data as it travels across links. This may include internal traffic, but it is even more important to protect the data that travels outside of the organization to branch sites, telecommuter sites, and partner sites.

These are the four elements of secure communications:

- **Data Integrity** - Guarantees that the message was not altered. Any changes to data in transit will be detected. Integrity is ensured by implementing either of the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-2 or SHA-3). The MD5 message digest algorithm is still widely in use but it is inherently insecure and creates vulnerabilities in a network. The use of MD5 should be avoided.
- **Origin Authentication** - Guarantees that the message is not a forgery and does actually come from whom it states. Many modern networks ensure authentication with protocols, such as hash message authentication code (HMAC).
- **Data Confidentiality** - Guarantees that only authorized users can read the message. If the message is intercepted, it cannot be deciphered within a reasonable amount of time. Data confidentiality is implemented using symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms.
- **Data Non-Repudiation** - Guarantees that the sender cannot repudiate, or refute, the validity of a message sent. Nonrepudiation relies on the fact that only the sender has the unique characteristics or signature for how that message is treated.

Cryptography can be used almost anywhere that there is data communication. In fact, the trend is toward all communication being encrypted.

## 3.10.3 Data Integrity
Hash functions are used to ensure the integrity of a message. They guarantee that message data has not changed accidentally.

In the figure, the sender is sending a $100 money transfer to Alex.
![[Pasted image 20241017145554.png]]The hash algorithm works as follows:

1. The sending device inputs the message into a hashing algorithm and computes its fixed-length hash of **4ehiDx67NMop9**.
2. This hash is then attached to the message and sent to the receiver. Both the message and the hash are in plaintext.
3. The receiving device removes the hash from the message and inputs the message into the same hashing algorithm. If the computed hash is equal to the one that is attached to the message, the message has not been altered during transit. If the hashes are not equal, as shown in the figure, then the integrity of the message can no longer be trusted.

## 3.10.4 Hash Functions
There are four well-known hash functions.

**MD5 with 128-bit Digest**

Developed by Ron Rivest and used in a variety of internet applications, MD5 is a one-way function that produces a 128-bit hashed message. MD5 is considered to be a legacy algorithm and should be avoided and used only when no better alternatives are available. It is recommended that SHA-2 or SHA-3 be used instead.
![[Pasted image 20241017145629.png]]
In the figure, a plaintext message is passed through an MD5 hash function. The result is a 128-bit hashed message.

**SHA Hashing Algorithm**

Developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) in 1995. It is very similar to the MD5 hash functions. Several versions exist. SHA-1 creates a 160-bit hashed message and is slightly slower than MD5. SHA-1 has known flaws and is a legacy algorithm.
![[Pasted image 20241017145657.png]]
In the figure, a plaintext message is passed through a SHA hash function. The result is a hashed message.

**SHA-2**  
  
Developed by the NSA. It includes SHA-224 (224 bit), SHA-256 (256 bit), SHA-384 (384 bit), and SHA-512 (512 bit). If you are using SHA-2, then the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms should be used whenever possible.

**SHA-3**  
  
SHA-3 is the newest hashing algorithm and was introduced by NIST as an alternative and eventual replacement for the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms. SHA-3 includes SHA3-224 (224 bit), SHA3-256 (256 bit), SHA3-384 (384 bit), and SHA3-512 (512 bit). The SHA-3 family are next-generation algorithms and should be used whenever possible.  
  
While hashing can be used to detect accidental changes, it cannot be used to guard against deliberate changes that are made by a threat actor. There is no unique identifying information from the sender in the hashing procedure. This means that anyone can compute a hash for any data, as long as they have the correct hash function.  
  
For example, when the message traverses the network, a potential attacker could intercept the message, change it, recalculate the hash, and append it to the message. The receiving device will only validate against whatever hash is appended.  
  
Therefore, hashing is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and does not provide security to transmitted data. To provide integrity and origin authentication, something more is required.  
  
**Note:** Hashing algorithms only protect against accidental changes and does not protect the data from changes deliberately made by a threat actor.

## 3.10.5 Origin Authentication
To add authentication to integrity assurance, use a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC uses an additional secret key as input to the hash function.

### HMAC Hashing Algorithm
As shown in the figure, an HMAC is calculated using any cryptographic algorithm that combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key. Hash functions are the basis of the protection mechanism of HMACs.

Only the sender and the receiver know the secret key, and the output of the hash function now depends on the input data and the secret key. Only parties who have access to that secret key can compute the digest of an HMAC function. This defeats man-in-the-middle attacks and provides authentication of the data origin.

If two parties share a secret key and use HMAC functions for authentication, a properly constructed HMAC digest of a message that a party has received indicates that the other party was the originator of the message. This is because the other party possesses the secret key.
![[Pasted image 20241017145752.png]]

### Value
As shown in the figure, the sending device inputs data (such as Terry Smithâ€™s pay of $100 and the secret key) into the hashing algorithm and calculates the fixed-length HMAC digest. This authenticated digest is then attached to the message and sent to the receiver.
![[Pasted image 20241017145814.png]]

## Verifying the HMAC Value
In the figure, the receiving device removes the digest from the message and uses the plaintext message with its secret key as input into the same hashing function. If the digest that is calculated by the receiving device is equal to the digest that was sent, the message has not been altered. Additionally, the origin of the message is authenticated because only the sender possesses a copy of the shared secret key. The HMAC function has ensured the authenticity of the message.
![[Pasted image 20241017145853.png]]

### Cisco Router HMAC Example
The figure shows how HMACs are used by Cisco routers that are configured to use Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing authentication.

R1 is sending a link state update (LSU) regarding a route to network 10.2.0.0/16:

1. R1 calculates the hash value using the LSU message and the secret key.
2. The resulting hash value is sent with the LSU to R2.
3. R2 calculates the hash value using the LSU and its secret key. R2 accepts the update if the hash values match. If they do not match, R2 discards the update.
![[Pasted image 20241017145925.png]]

### 3.10.6 Data Confidentiality
There are two classes of encryption used to provide data confidentiality. These two classes differ in how they use keys.

Symmetric encryption algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are based on the premise that each communicating party knows the pre-shared key. Data confidentiality can also be ensured using asymmetric algorithms, including Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) and the public key infrastructure (PKI).

**Note:** DES is a legacy algorithm and should not be used. 3DES should be avoided if possible.  
  
The figure highlights some differences between each encryption algorithm method.

The figure shows the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Characteristics of symmetric encryption include: use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data; key lengths are short (40 bits - 256 bits); faster than asymmetric encryption; and commonly used for encrypting bulk data such as in VPN traffic. Characteristics of asymmetric encryption include: uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data; key lengths are long (512 bits - 4096 bits); computationally tasking therefore slower than symmetric encryption; and commonly used for quick data transactions such as HTTPS when accessing your bank data.
![[Pasted image 20241017145948.png]]
## 3.10.7 Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric algorithms use the same pre-shared key to encrypt and decrypt data. A pre-shared key, also called a secret key, is known by the sender and receiver before any encrypted communications can take place.

To help illustrate how symmetric encryption works, consider an example where Alice and Bob live in different locations and want to exchange secret messages with one another through the mail system. In this example, Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob.

In the figure, Alice and Bob have identical keys to a single padlock. These keys were exchanged prior to sending any secret messages. Alice writes a secret message and puts it in a small box that she locks using the padlock with her key. She mails the box to Bob. The message is safely locked inside the box as the box makes its way through the post office system. When Bob receives the box, he uses his key to unlock the padlock and retrieve the message. Bob can use the same box and padlock to send a secret reply to Alice.

### Symmetric Encryption Example
![[Pasted image 20241017150023.png]]
Symmetric encryption algorithms fall into two categories, block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-sized blocks. The blocks are usually 64-bit or 128-bit. Padding is added if the plaintext data length is not a multiple of 8 to make a complete block. Examples of block ciphers include DES, and AES. Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time in a continuous string.  
  
Examples of stream ciphers includes RC4 and SEAL.

Today, symmetric encryption algorithms are commonly used with VPN traffic. This is because symmetric algorithms use less CPU resources than asymmetric encryption algorithms. Encryption and decryption of data is fast when using a VPN. When using symmetric encryption algorithms, like any other type of encryption, the longer the key, the longer it will take for someone to discover the key. Most encryption keys are between 112 and 256 bits. To ensure that the encryption is safe, use a minimum key length of 128 bits. Use a longer key for more secure communications.

Well-known symmetric encryption algorithms are described in the table.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**                 | This is a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm. It uses a short key length that makes it insecure for most current uses.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **3DES (Triple DES)**                              | The is the replacement for DES and repeats the DES algorithm process three times. It should be avoided if possible as it is scheduled to be retired in 2023. If implemented, use very short key lifetimes.                                                                                       |
| **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**             | AES is a secure and more efficient algorithm than 3DES. It is a popular and recommended symmetric encryption algorithm. It offers nine combinations of key and block length by using a variable key length of 128-, 192-, or 256-bit key to encrypt data block that are 128, 192, 256 bits long. |
| **Software-Optimized Encryption Algorithm (SEAL)** | SEAL is a faster alternative symmetric encryption algorithm to DES, 3DES, and AES. It uses a 160-bit encryption key and has a lower impact on the CPU compared to other software-based algorithms.                                                                                               |
| **Rivest ciphers (RC) series algorithms**          | This algorithm was developed by Ron Rivest. Several variations have been developed, but RC4 is the most prevalent in use. RC4 is cipher that was used to secure web traffic. It has been found to have multiple vulnerabilities which have made it insecure. RC4 should not be used.             |

## 3.10.8 Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric algorithms, also called public-key algorithms, are designed so that the key that is used for encryption is different from the key that is used for decryption, as shown in the figure. The decryption key cannot, in any reasonable amount of time, be calculated from the encryption key and vice versa.

Asymmetric algorithms use a public key and a private key. Both keys are capable of the encryption process, but the complementary paired key is required for decryption. The process is also reversible. Data encrypted with the public key requires the private key to decrypt. Asymmetric algorithms achieve confidentiality, authentication, and integrity by using this process.

### Asymmetric Encryption Example
![[Pasted image 20241017150848.png]]Because neither party has a shared secret, very long key lengths must be used. Asymmetric encryption can use key lengths between 512 to 4,096 bits. Key lengths greater than or equal to 2,048 bits can be trusted while shorter key lengths are considered unreliable.

Examples of protocols that use asymmetric key algorithms include:

- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** - This is a fundamental component of IPsec VPNs.
- **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)** - This is now implemented as IETF standard Transport Layer Security (TLS).
- **Secure Shell (SSH)** - This protocol provides a secure remote access connection to network devices.
- **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)** - This computer program provides cryptographic privacy and authentication. It is often used to increase the security of email communications.

Asymmetric algorithms are substantially slower than symmetric algorithms. Their design is based on computational problems, such as factoring extremely large numbers or computing discrete logarithms of extremely large numbers.

Because they are slow, asymmetric algorithms are typically used in low-volume cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures and key exchange. However, the key management of asymmetric algorithms tends to be simpler than symmetric algorithms, because usually one of the two encryption or decryption keys can be made public.

Common examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms are described in the table.

## 3.10.9 Diffie-Hellman
Diffie-Hellman (DH) is an asymmetric mathematical algorithm where two computers generate an identical shared secret key without having communicated before. The new shared key is never actually exchanged between the sender and receiver. However, because both parties know it, the key can be used by an encryption algorithm to encrypt traffic between the two systems.

Here are three examples of instances when DH is commonly used:

- Data is exchanged using an IPsec VPN.
- Used when data is exchanged using an SSL or TLS VPN.
- SSH data is exchanged.

To help illustrate how DH operates, refer to the figure.
![[Pasted image 20241017151843.png]]The colors in the figure will be used instead of complex long numbers to simplify the DH key agreement process. The DH key exchange begins with Alice and Bob agreeing on an arbitrary common color that does not need to be kept secret. The agreed-on color in our example is yellow.

Next, Alice and Bob will each select a secret color. Alice chose red while Bob chose blue. These secret colors will never be shared with anyone. The secret color represents the chosen secret private key of each party.

Alice and Bob now mix the shared common color (yellow) with their respective secret color to produce a public color. Therefore, Alice will mix the yellow with her red color to produce a public color of orange. Bob will mix the yellow and the blue to produce a public color of green.

Alice sends her public color (orange) to Bob and Bob sends his public color (green) to Alice.

Alice and Bob each mix the color they received with their own, original secret color (Red for Alice and blue for Bob.). The result is a final brown color mixture that is identical to the partnerâ€™s final color mixture. The brown color represents the resulting shared secret key between Bob and Alice.

The security of DH is based on the fact that it uses very large numbers in its calculations. For example, a DH 1024-bit number is roughly equal to a decimal number of 309 digits. Considering that a billion is 10 decimal digits (1,000,000,000), one can easily imagine the complexity of working with not one, but multiple 309 digit decimal numbers.

Unfortunately, asymmetric key systems are extremely slow for any sort of bulk encryption. This is why it is common to encrypt the bulk of the traffic using a symmetric algorithm, such as 3DES or AES and use the DH algorithm to create keys that will be used by the encryption algorithm.
